<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Redirecting to Login Page</title>
    <script>
      window.location.replace("Source_Code/login.php");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Redirecting to Login Page...</h1>
    <p>If you are not automatically redirected, please <a href="Source_Code/login.php">click here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
In this example, we're using the window.location.replace() method to redirect the user to the login page. This method replaces the current page in the browser history with the new page, which prevents the user from using the back button to return to the previous page. If you want to allow the user to go back to the previous page, you can use the window.location.href property instead.

With this approach, you can still provide a fallback link for users who have JavaScript disabled by using the <noscript> tag:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Redirecting to Login Page</title
